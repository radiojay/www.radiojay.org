# RadioJay Whitepapers



- [Ultra-lightweight GPS bird tags](ultra-lightweight-gps-tags.md) describes the tradeoffs
  made to arrive at sub-gram birds trackers with GPS.
- [Manufacturing tags and costs](tag-manufacturing-costs.md) describes how the RadioJay tags
  can be manufactured.
- [Motus tags that collect data](Motus-data-tags.md) looks into the options for adding sensors that
  collect data to Motus tags and how this data can later be transmitted to Motus stations.
- [Proposal for extending the CTT packet format](extending-motus-protocol.md) in order to add data
  to each transmission in a backwards-compatible manner.
