Tag operation
=============


- Is a 1 gram or lighter GPS + radio tag possible? Yes! But...
  - it requires a whole systems approach tailored to the study objectives
  - it requires planning and compromises
- Expected functionality:
  - collect multiple GPS fixes per day
  - store GPS fixes on-board
  - transmit GPS fixes via radio when in range of station
- Caveats
  - GPS is power hungry, so is radio transmission: at 1 gram and below the power budget is very limited
  - expect a handful of fixes per day 
  - expect dozens of fixes transmitted by radio
  - expect to craft a schedule that attempts to acquire GPS fixes when useful to the study objectives
- Use solar, smarts and sensors to overcome limited power budget
  - collect fixes when bird is flying
  - use geo-fencing to gate fix acquisition
