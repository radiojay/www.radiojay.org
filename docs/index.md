# Introduction

RadioJay: open-source lighweight tracking tags with radio for birds.

![glossy screen capture](index-pic.jpg){width="40%" align="right"}

The RadioJay project explores the feasibility of "DIY"/open-source lightweight tracking
tags with radio transmission for tracking birds.
The primary goal is to be able to experiment with new technologies in order to enable new
ornithological research in bird migration or other activities.

## Goals

- Tag weight around 1 gram, depending on features, sub-gram is possible, in others
  the power requirements may make it impossible with current technology.
- Compatibility with the [Motus Wildlife tracking system](https://motus.org) where
  practical and beneficial, but also attempt to inform where new technologies could enhance Motus.
- Support for sensors, including accelerometer, altimeter, and light meter.
- Ability to store and pre-process sensor data on-board.
- Solar battery recharge with sophisticated energy management.
- Multiple radio technologies, including FSK, LoRa, LoRaWAN, possibly NB-IoT.
- Transmission of live data as well as uploading of stored/recorded data
- Support GNSS in both standalone mode as well as snapshot/cloud processing mode.
- Compatibility with readily available manufacturing services, including low-cost low-volume.

## Licensing

The tag designs are generally open-source, however, commercial use of the software requires
a modest license fee, intended to provide funds for the project.
